ðŸŸ© Day 1 â€“ Basic Form + Display in URL

Built a basic HTML form with:

Name, Email, Password, Department fields
Used GET method to:

Display submitted form data in the URL query string
Show submitted data on screen using JavaScript
No backend; everything was handled on the frontend.

ðŸŸ© Day 2 â€“ Raw Node.js Backend Setup
Created a custom Node.js server (no Express).

Used POST method to:

Handle form submissions and store data in a global array
Created a second HTML page to:

Fetch and display student data in a table
Data was non-persistent (lost after server restart).

ðŸŸ© Day 3 â€“ Express.js Integration + REST API
Migrated to Express.js for backend simplicity.

Set up the following RESTful routes:

POST /submit: Add student
GET /students: Get all students
PUT /students/:index: Update student
DELETE /students/:index: Delete student
Created show.html to:

List all students with Edit/Delete buttons
Added edit functionality using query string.

ðŸŸ© Day 4 â€“ Dynamic Edit Form + Validations
Converted create-student/index.html form to:

Dynamic behavior using ?studentIndex=...
Fetch and pre-fill student data for editing
Submit button changes to Update when editing

Added form validations:

Required fields
Valid email format
Password length â‰¥ 8
Displayed alerts on validation or fetch errors

ðŸŸ© Day 5 â€“ Folder Structure + Subject Details + View Page
Organized project folder structure:
src/ backend/ (index.js) frontend/ create-student/ view-student/ create-subject/

Changed default route / to load student list (index.html)

Created student detail page student.html with:

Table 1: Student info
Table 2: Subject list for that student
Edit/Delete/Update for subjects
Total marks, obtained marks, and percentage row
Created create-subject/index.html to add subject per student

Added Back Button on edit form

Fixed 404 path issues and made all URLs relative to new folder structure

ðŸŸ© Day 6 â€“ Test Module, Subject View & Inline Edits
âœ… Test Feature Added

Created full CRUD for tests linked to a subject:

POST /tests
GET /tests/:subjectId
PUT /tests/:id
DELETE /tests/:id
âœ… view-subject Page Created

Displays:
Student Info (Table 1)
Subject Info (Table 2)
List of Tests (Table 3)
Linked from "View" button on subject list
âœ… Inline Editing Implemented

Tests can now be edited directly in the table
Includes Save and Cancel features
Grade and percentage auto-calculated from backend after saving
âœ… Navigation Fixes

Fixed bug in view-subject route: subjectId now passed and used correctly
Back and Add Test buttons work with studentIndex and subjectId
ðŸŸ© Day 7 â€“ Backend Finalization, Grade Calculation, and Display Fixes
âœ… Student Grade Fix (Server-side)

Grade and percentage now calculated dynamically on backend:

In /students route
In /students/:index route
Fixed display where grade was missing in:

index.html
view-student
view-subject
âœ… Consistent Grade Rendering

Ensured grade is available and displayed in all views
Removed client-side grade logic completely
âœ… Backend Code Review

Walked through entire index.js line-by-line:

Route purposes
Logic for computing marks, percentage, grade
CRUD flow for students, subjects, and tests
âœ… Complete System Review

You now have:

Full stack system
Inline edits
Grade tracking
Clean routing & modular structure
âœ… 7-Day Accomplishment Summary:

âœ… Node.js (Express.js) backend
âœ… HTML/CSS/JS frontend
âœ… Student, Subject, and Test modules
âœ… Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
